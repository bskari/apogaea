Goggles
=======

These started out as Adafruit's [goggle
kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2221) but I have since modified them to
be infinity mirrors. I wanted to be able to see through them normally, so I
made some changes from normal infinity mirrors. Normal infinity mirrors use
approximately 30% transparent acrylic, and because my eyes would be sitting
behind 2 layers of acrylic, only about 9% of outside light would reach my eyes.
Couple that with bright LEDs between the layers, and I wouldn't be able to see
very well. So instead, I used some [iridescent
acrylic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W79TL99) which is less
reflective, but allows more light through. This does reduce the effect infinity
mirror effect, but I think it's a good tradeoff. Second, I put a red filter
between my eyes and the LEDs. The red filter blocks nearly all blue and green
light, so if I only turn on those LEDs, the light doesn't bother me. Finally, I
cut some circular inserts with a hole in the middle on my Cricut and added them
in front of my eyes. Because the LEDs are along the rim, the inserts block most
of that light, at the expense of limiting my field of view somewhat.
