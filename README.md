LED projects
============

Various LED art projects that I use for Apogaea or other festivals.

Bicycle
-------

LED animations for my bicycle. LED strips, spokes, and hopefully more to come.

Goggles
-------

Infinity mirror goggles, inspired/stolen from [theindian08 on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/8i6m5w/) Previously this was
Adafruit's [goggle project](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2221). I added a
microphone, some other animations, and a button.

Helmet
------

Some simple animations for a helmeted costume.

Monk
----

I saw [LightStuff infinity mirror
mask](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCwOx3URL7J/) and wanted to make my own.
Animations, button, sound reactive.

Vest
----

Fur vest with LEDs that make it glow. Inspired/stolen from the [LED
vest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8TyGCo32pY) by
[Finominal](https://github.com/finominal). Check out [their
code](https://github.com/finominal/LedVestPlasmaGenerator).
