LED projects
============

Various LED art projects that I use for Apogaea or other festivals.

Bicycle
-------

Just some simple animations for a couple LED strips I attached to my bike.

Goggles
-------

Adafruit's [goggle project](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2221). I added a
microphone, some other animations, and a button.

Helmet
------

Some simple animations for a helmeted costume.

Monk
----

I saw [LightStuff infinity mirror mask](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCwOx3URL7J/)
and wanted to make my own. Animations, button, sound reactive.

Vest
----

Fur vest with LEDs that make it glow.
